# Analog and Digital Filters Practice Repository

In this repository I explore and practice with both analog and digital filters. It serves as a personal playground for me to understand the intricacies of these filters and their applications in various domains.

## Why Filters?

Filters, both analog and digital, are fundamental components in the field of signal processing. They help us manipulate signals in desired ways, removing unnecessary noise or enhancing certain features. By practicing with these filters, I aim to deepen my understanding and improve my skills in signal processing.
